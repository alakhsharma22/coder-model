#  Results Discussion: Maximum Vending Machine Profit

##  Problem Summary

**Problem Name:** Maximum Vending Machine Profit  
**Goal:** Given `k` soda bottles each with a brand and cost, and `n` shelves (each of which must contain bottles of only one brand), determine the **maximum profit** from placing bottles on shelves, assuming all are sold.

## ðŸ§¾ Evaluation Results

| Metric           | Value     |
|------------------|-----------|
|  Passed Tests   | 1 / 1     |
|  Reward Score   | 1.0       |
|  Compile Errors | None      |
|  Timeouts       | None      |
|  Memory Errors  | None      |

##  Observations

- The model successfully produced a correct and complete C++ solution that compiled, executed, and passed the sample test case.
- No post-processing or fallback code was needed for this solution.
- Reward score of `1.0` confirms it met all criteria for correctness and runtime constraints.
